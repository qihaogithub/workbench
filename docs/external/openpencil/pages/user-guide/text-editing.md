# Text Editing

Create text nodes and edit them directly on the canvas with full rich text support.

## Creating Text

Press T to activate the text tool, then click on the canvas. An empty text node appears with a blinking cursor — start typing immediately.

## Inline Editing

Double-click any existing text node to enter inline editing mode. A blue outline appears around the text to indicate edit mode. Click outside the text node to commit and exit editing.

Text is rendered directly on the canvas — there's no separate text input overlay.

## Cursor Navigation

| Action | Mac | Windows / Linux |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Move left/right | ← / → | ← / → |
| Move up/down | ↑ / ↓ | ↑ / ↓ |
| Move by word | ⌥← / ⌥→ | Ctrl + ← / Ctrl + → |
| Move to line start/end | ⌘← / ⌘→ | Home / End |

Hold Shift with any movement key to extend the selection.

## Text Selection

* **Click** inside a text node to position the cursor
* **Click + drag** to select a range of text
* **Double-click** a word to select it
* **Triple-click** to select all text in the node

## Rich Text Formatting

Apply formatting to selected text, or toggle the style for the entire node when nothing is selected.

| Action | Mac | Windows / Linux |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Bold | ⌘B | Ctrl + B |
| Italic | ⌘I | Ctrl + I |
| Underline | ⌘U | Ctrl + U |

Strikethrough is available via the **S** toggle button in the Typography section of the properties panel (no keyboard shortcut — ⌘S is used for Save).

Formatting is applied per character. When you type between a bold and regular segment, the new text inherits the style of the preceding segment.

The **B / I / U / S** toggle buttons in the Typography section of the properties panel also apply formatting.

## Editing Operations

| Action | Mac | Windows / Linux |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Delete word before cursor | ⌥⌫ | Ctrl + Backspace |
| Delete to line start | ⌘⌫ | — |
| Cut | ⌘X | Ctrl + X |
| Copy | ⌘C | Ctrl + C |
| Paste | ⌘V | Ctrl + V |

## Font Picker

Open the font picker in the Typography section of the properties panel to change the font family. The picker features:

* **Search filter** — type to narrow the font list
* **Font preview** — each font name is rendered in its own typeface
* **Virtual scroll** — handles large font lists efficiently
* **Scroll-to-current** — the current font is highlighted when the picker opens

## Font Weight

Change the font weight in the Typography section of the properties panel. Available weights depend on the selected font family (e.g., Regular, Medium, Bold, Black).

## Font Sources

* **Default font** — Inter is loaded automatically
* **Desktop app** — all system fonts are available
* **Browser** — system fonts are available in Chrome and Edge

## Tips

* The font list is preloaded at startup so the picker opens without delay.
* IME input (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) is fully supported.
* Rich text formatting is preserved when opening and saving .fig files.
* See [Components](./components) for how text overrides work in component instances.
